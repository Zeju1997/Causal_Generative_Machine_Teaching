# Iterative Teaching by Data Hallucination


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the official github repository for our work [Iterative Teaching by Data Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17467.pdf).


We consider the problem of iterative machine teaching, where a teacher sequentially provides
examples based on the status of a learner under a discrete input space (i.e., a pool of finite samples), 
which greatly limits the teacher’s capability. To address this issue, we study iterative teaching under 
a continuous input space where the input example (i.e., image) can be either generated by solving an 
optimization problem or drawn directly from a continuous distribution. Specifically, we propose 
data hallucination teaching (DHT) where the teacher can generate input data intelligently based on labels, 
the learner’s status and the target concept. We study a number of challenging teaching setups 
(e.g., linear/neural learners in omniscient and black-box settings).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Data

We evaluate our data hullucination teaching framework on common image classification data, including MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.
Create a folder named `data` in the root directory and the datasets will be automatically downloaded to the repository first
time when the training is executed.

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Install required packages
   ```sh
    conda create -n dht python=3.6
    conda activate dht
    conda install pytorch==1.10.0 torchvision==0.11.0 torchaudio==0.10.0 -c pytorch
    pip install imageio scikit-image matplotlib mathutils==2.81.2 
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
